# Basic Discord Bot
This is a basic [Discord](https://discordapp.com) bot template, a starting point for any developer that plans to use [Discord.py](https://github.com/Rapptz/discord.py) as part of their architecture.

-------------------------

### Development
When using this template to make your custom discord bot, make sure to use [Python 3.6.4] (https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-364/) and you can make any changes to this project, that's fine...

### Deployment
I choose [Heroku](https://heroku.com) because its free unless you have any requirment of databases. 

Make Sure to check this tutorial, if you have any trouble hosting the bot on heroku!
